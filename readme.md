# Computer Vision on tennis and basketball balls 

This follow the 2nd chapter of Deep learning for coders book. 
We used transfer learning to rapidly train a model that classify tennis and basketball balls. 
Results were pretty good without much tuning. 
Accuracy 93% on 20% validation set. 
What is very interesting is that the model (resnet18) adapted rapidly and with an small training set to the data. 

## Where did the data came from? 

I downloaded photos from the Bing images API. 
I removed the photos that did not correspond to the task (basketball shoes for ex.)

## I tries some of my own photos and the results where perfect.
